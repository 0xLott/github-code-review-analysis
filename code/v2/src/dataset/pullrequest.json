Seems to intersect w/ #7853 and #9145, the latter I believe it closes, at least accounts for it from the documentation side of things (as the currently recommended open weather map API leads to a funny experience, at least for Chrome users).\n",

When I started contributing, I also joined the Contributors chat room. From my own experience and the experience of many other new contributors, I've found there's an issue in the `npm run only-once` command. `\\n` on Windows doesn't add a new line. In fact, it's even worse. In the script, it seems to break. This pull request removes the new lines. I realize that this does make these little messages harder to catch. I think the trade-off is worth it, though. Because there is no new output for a while after the first message, and the last message is the very last thing logged, they're still hard to miss. I did some research on getting newlines in the command line on Windows, but there doesn't seem to be an easy cross-platform solution.  \nI hope this will help out new contributors, taking one more bump out of the road of contributing to a large open source project. \ud83d\udd25 \n",

I looked into [/common/app/redux/types.js](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/common/app/redux/types.js) which contains all the action types with prefix `app`, and `makeToast` is no where to be found.

That issue itself has been closed since, as it originally dealt with another problem, that has been resolved through a different PR. \r\n\r\nA few things about this PR - \r\n\r\n1. I did not check the \"_PR targets the staging branch_\" checkbox because this change already exists in the `staging` branch. I was told to target the `backup/staging` branch instead, as this is (kind of) the production site.\r\n\r\n2. The issue where this problem was mentioned in, is already closed. So I just mentioned the issue number in the PR template, I did not create a separate `closes XXXXX` comment, as is the norm.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

Today (in my timezone, this is technically the same day \ud83d\ude04), I was installing Free Code Camp with @tearingItUp786, and we faced the same errors. As it now was obvious to me this was definitely not an environment issue or user error, I decided to investigate.\r\nThis error prevents all Javascript from loading, which makes it impossible to test out anything you develop.\r\nWith the help of @cmal, I found that the cause was in react-hot-loader, and the way it interacts with React. The most recent version of React is `15.4.0`, which is allowed by our package.json (`^15.0.2` takes the most recent `15.x.x`). That had a change that made it incompatible with react-hot-loader version `1.x.x`, which is what we're using.\r\nThis change was very recent, and according to Google, more people have struggled with this starting about three days ago.\r\nThis is fixed in react-hot-loader v3, but that's still in beta. According to the creator however, it's more stable ([source](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/417#issuecomment-260995694)). I decided to try to upgrade to this version and see if things would work. It seems like it does!\r\nI'm not familiar with how the hot reloading used to work. With the current state of things, it's hard for me to find out. From what I can tell, it seems to work as it should, but a thorough test by someone who really knows how this is supposed to work would be much appreciated.\r\nI'm not a fan of using a beta version, but as it's more stable according to the creator, and because currently it just doesn't work completely, I believe that this is the best solution.\r\n\r\nI view this bug as quite high priority, as any new contributors can currently not get started.",

Here's a summary:\r\n- My editor (Atom) automatically removed some trailing spaces\r\n- There was only a single \"I\" in the entire file. I changed it to be more consistent.\r\n- The Contributors chat room on Gitter is referenced as \"Contributors chat room,\" \"Contributors Chat Room\" and \"Contributors room\", sometimes as a link, sometimes not. I edited some cases to be more consistent.\r\n- The \"How to find the code in the Free Code Camp codebase to fix/edit?\" was in the PR section. I moved it near \"Make changes\" to hopefully be easier to find and harder to miss.\r\n- With the current state of the project, after making changes to the seed files, you need to run `node seed` for them to be visible. This was never mentioned in this file. I added a section that talks about this. I assume it wasn't there because it previously updated automatically. I hope this helps resolve a common confusion among new contributors.\r\n- Previously, the test section mentioned running a different command on Windows to test. This has been fixed (ref #10885), so I removed that part.\r\n- The linting section mentioned that lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters because of jsonlint. I'm not sure why or how that ever worked. As the name might suggest, jsonlint only lints the JSON. The linting talked about in this section only lints the .js and .jsx files. There is no maximum line length in the JSON files. I have tested this, it doesn't break. I removed this section because it seemed to be false information. \ud83d\ude05 Apart from that, it seems weird to me to only detail a single rule out of alllll of them.\r\n- These last two are really nitpicking. I fixed the casing on a username. I also switched the order of two items in an unordered list to match the headings that followed it.\r\n\r\nI know it's not such a great idea to stuff many different things into a single PR, but once I got started, I couldn't stop myself \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nHave a great day! \ud83d\udd25 ",

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of redux-form.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn\u2019t right?\nAre you unsure about how things are supposed to work?\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I\u2019m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things.

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-redux.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\nDo you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn\u2019t right?\nAre you unsure about how things are supposed to work?\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I\u2019m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n\nGood luck with your project :sparkles:\n\nYou rock!\n\n:palm_tree:\n\n---\n[GitHub Release](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\n\n<p>This release is brought to you by contributions from the following people: <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/jimbolla\" class=\"user-mention\">@jimbolla</a>, <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/vhmth\" class=\"user-mention\">@vhmth</a>, <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/btd\" class=\"user-mention\">@btd</a>, <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/roncohen\" class=\"user-mention\">@roncohen</a>, <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/ynonp\" class=\"user-mention\">@ynonp</a>, and <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/appden\" class=\"user-mention\">@appden</a>. In addition, there were many non-code contributions in discussions on issues and testing the alpha, beta, and rc versions by many other folks (too many to list!). Thank you to everyone who made this a very positive, inclusive, well-critiqued, community-driven release!</p>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Backwards compatible API</li>\n<li>Major internal changes</li>\n<li>Significant <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/reactjs/react-redux/pull/416\">performance improvements</a> in common usage patterns</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/reactjs/react-redux/pull/416#issuecomment-233144992\">Bugs fixed</a></li>\n<li>Additional features added to <code>connect()</code>\n</li>\n<li>New <code>connectAdvanced()</code> API</li>\n<li>What's next?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>API Compatibility</h3>\n\n<p>Version 5.0 maintains API compatibility with v4.x but due to major internal changes and potential behavior differences across nearly all API surfaces, <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">semver</a> dictates a major version bump. Also, it's good marketing! <g-emoji alias=\"moneybag\" fallback-src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4b0.png\" ios-version=\"6.0\">\ud83d\udcb0</g-emoji>  Store state change notifications sent to components are now guaranteed to occur top-down, so if your code may behave differently if it relied on notifications happening out of order.</p>\n\n<h3>Internal Changes</h3>\n\n<p>Internally, the code for <code>connect</code> has been rewritten from the ground-up to be more modular, with the intention of greater maintainability and extensibility. This has also led to some new features and performance improvements.</p>\n\n<h3>Performance improvements</h3>\n\n<p>Significant performance gains were achieved by avoiding extra calls to <code>setState()</code> and <code>render()</code> by ensuring the order of change notifications to occur top-down, matching React's natural flow. Performance tests and benchmarks are discussed in <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/reactjs/react-redux/pull/416\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/issues/416\" data-id=\"162071270\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\">#416</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Bugfixes</h3>\n\n<p>Some bugs/issues are resolved, related to performance loss and also impure components not re-rendering.</p>\n\n<h3>New features added to connect()</h3>\n\n<p>The behavior of <code>connect()</code> is now more customizable, by passing additional properties in the <code>options</code> arg. These will be described in the API docs.</p>\n\n<h3>New top level API: connectAdvanced()</h3>\n\n<p>The new implementation of <code>connect()</code> splits its behavior such that it is now a wrapper around a more-generalized <code>connectAdvanced()</code>. This <code>connectAdvanced()</code> method can be called directly if you have extreme performance needs or want to craft an API different than that of <code>connect()</code>. This will be described in the API docs.</p>\n\n<h3>What's next?</h3>\n\n<p>We're looking at <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/reactjs/react-redux/issues/507\">removing the <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> optimization</a>. Since this version is much more performant on its own, that isn't needed. This will fix long-standing problems with other libraries that use React's <code>context</code> API. There are workarounds, but things should work without either library authors having to bend over backwards or React having to make API changes.</p>\n\n<p>We will accept bugfixes on the 4.x branch (the 3.x branch will be going away; but the tags to 3.x versions will remain!), but new features should be built against the <code>next</code> branch. We love PRs, so keep them coming!</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/reactjs/react-redux/compare/v5.0.0-rc.1...v5.0.0\">Changes since v5.0.0-rc.1</a></h2>\n\n---\nThe new version differs by 197 commits .\n\n- [`e23991f`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/commit/e23991fab5080ebe60858b3775121ba0416a556a) <code>5.0.0</code>\n- [`f892ec0`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/commit/f892ec00d7e92ff7afb21498276472f0e3b000c5) <code>5.0.0-rc.2</code>\n- [`710cb85`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/commit/710cb85df7e8bafd9705b557425c96deba6d78fd) <code>Update yarn deps</code>\n- [`2000ff5`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/commit/2000ff54aef486d955a7eb4fe9594e0b5e273458) <code>Fixes #525 (cursor bug) by moving notify from setState callback to componentDidUpdate.

They now stay as is.\r\n- Objects are prettified.\r\n- Arrays get an extra space, like they have in the browser console.\r\n\r\n### Things that aren't perfect yet\r\n_Nested arrays are now recursively parsed._\r\n- ~Nested arrays and~ property values are still handled by `JSON.stringify`, so they still have the `NaN` -> `null` issue.\r\n- All strings that start with // are displayed as comments.\r\n- ~The indentation of indented arrays doesn't necessarily have to be this way. I guess it comes down to our preference.~\r\n- If there is a lot of logging output, the performance hit may be too big. This change doesn't affect that a whole lot though. It might be good to not log anything larger than `x`.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Tests are still broken as per #12305. I ran them with the fix from #12317, and they passed.~ Tests have been fixed",

There's also replacements in `seed/challenges/04-video-challenges/jslingo.json`, but from here on out will be targeting one directory per PR. This way QA will hopefully not be too much of a nightmare for this if too much at once is changed. \r\n\r\nI tried to update just about anything a user can see and anything else that might be searchable including, email domains (from `...@freecodecamp.com` to `...@freeCodeCamp.com`), user facing URLs/links, copy, etc., while leaving alone `href` attributes and instances of `freecodecamp` in file names, etc. Hopefully this is what was intended. If anything looks wrong, please let me know and I will fix and make a new PR.",

Similar to the issue seen in #12722. This challenge uses a regex to count the quotes in the `code` variable, so `'use strict'` and the `tail` was throwing off the count. Logging `code` looks like this:\r\n```\r\n<script>\r\n\r\n;/*fcc*/\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nvar myStr = '<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>;';\r\n;/*fcc*/\r\n\r\n(function() { return \"myStr = \" + myStr; })();\r\n\r\n;/*fcc*/\r\n</script>\r\n<!--fcc-->\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there is an additional pair of both `'` and `\"`. I tried to just accommodate for this by changing the test to account for the extra quotes, but my guess is that since this comment is not actually generated in nodes test environment, approaching it this way caused running `npm test` to fail.\r\n\r\nSo instead, I created an IIFE that executes within the assert and returns `true` or `false`. It slices `code` down to only the relevant parts then just runs the original regex matches against the new string.\r\n\r\nI also added `blockquote`s for the examples to be consistent with other challenges and added `Do not change anything else.` to the instructions because we are also testing that the string remains unchanged in the first test but don't explicitly say it anywhere, so if someone does what the tests ask but changes the URL in the string, the tests will fail with an erroneous error message.

I did hit some URLs (only the ones that we've changed, i.e. github, codepen), and, I even got the issue template! \r\n\r\nI did mention in #12472 that I did leave a few instances of `freecodecamp` in the Twitch challenge, because not sure how the API would interpret the case change. Also, our name has not yet been changed on Twitch, and we may have left that out of the change plan (looks like we're still FreeCodeCampin' over there! \ud83d\ude1c  ).\r\n\r\nAnyway, one step closer to putting this issue to rest finally!

Used `<blockquote>` to contain the example code, instead of `<code>` tags, as recommended in issue.\r\n2. Removed this from the challenge seed - `a = b; b = a;`. This causes `a` to be `6`, without even using array destructuring, and the first test I wrote passes by default. I think having the first test passing, without writing any code to use array destructuring at all, might confuse campers.\r\n3. Wrote tests to ensure value of `a` and `b` was `6` and `8` respectively after destructuring, and to check array destructuring was used.\r\n\r\nTested locally - \r\n\r\n![screenshot 2017-02-19 02 20 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11348778/23100326/3e246972-f64c-11e6-9aca-445f2a63cb8a.png)\r\n\r\nCloses #13268 ",

This code passes all the tests- \r\n```\r\nthis.remove = function(element) {\r\n      if(this.has(element)) {\r\n        var pos = collection.indexOf(element);\r\n        collection.splice(pos, 1);\r\n        return true;\r\n      }\r\n      return false;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nwhile just removing `element` without checking if it exists, fails the new test.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed some minor formatting issues.\r\n\r\nCloses #13312 ",

Updated english page URLs as well as all corresponding translations. \r\n\r\nThe updated projects were originally built for use in the testable projects project, and since we ultimately did not use them there (since we determined the recipe box and game of life would be nightmares to test and would restrict approach and creativity on the camper's part) we decided to update those two projects here. Also added @bonham000's Dungeon Crawler since it is just so darn FCC how could it possibly be resisted?\r\n\r\nSo updated pens include:\r\n- [game of life](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/BpwMZv/)\r\n- [recipe box](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/dNVazZ)\r\n- [dungeon crawler](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/apLXEJ/)\r\n\r\nOther benefits of these pens are that the recipe box is arguably a more complete version of this app, as it contains a place for directions rather than just name and ingredients, and the game of life project provides an example that is a more common approach to the problem from a solution perspective. \r\n\r\nThe CodePen projects featured in this section, now exactly match up with [this](https://codepen.io/collection/DdpVqq/) CodePen collection.\r\n\r\n",

Shorter is always better, as long as nothing meaningful is lost. \r\n\r\nFor example, the second sentence originally finished with \"walk you through web development step-by-step\". But hyphens should be used here only if \"step by step\" appeared before the noun, as in a \"step-by-step recovery\". Since the phrase follows the noun, no hyphens.\r\n\r\nAnother grammar error: the comma in \"do these in order, but feel free\". You use a comma before \"but\" only when joining two independent clauses, which is not the case here. \r\n\r\nAs for redundancies: you don't need to preface \"you'll start\" with \"First.\" To start implies first. Same goes for joining a \"local\" study group in \"your city.\" If it's in your city, it's local. The text also repeats the instruction to press the \"Run tests\" button. And the words \"Note that\" are never necessary. If you didn't want us to note it, you wouldn't have written it. \r\n\r\nAlso, though I understand this is written for beginners, it sometimes reads as if it were written for children. For example: \"Do you see the code in the text editor that...\" It's good that the instructions are written in a simple and informal way, but there is no need to condescend. \r\n\r\nOh, and the \"map on the left\" thing. The map is in the top menu on my browser, not on the left. Does it appear on the left for some? \r\n\r\nAnyway, much of this is nit-picky but just trying to help. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So I changed _even-numbered elements_ to _even elements_, which matches jQuery's doc.\r\n\r\nThird test was also off so I fixed that too.\r\n\r\n# open for discussion\r\njQuery's official doc tells us we should use the `filter` method for perf reasons. Should it be mentioned in this challenge?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

        "description": "@QuincyLarson @BerkeleyTrue this branch establishes compatibility between the [alpha version of the freeCodeCamp React/Redux Curriculum](https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module) and the core freeCodeCamp app.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This is a redo of previous PR because of issues with that branch. I've preserved my commit history here as a record of the sequence of changes I made.\r\n\r\nI've figured out how to reproduce the testing environment we used in the Alpha version of these challenges within the freeCodeCamp app, and this PR successfully demonstrates the implementation of several specific challenges. The challenges I selected as a whole encompass all of the functionality we rely on, so this effectively paves the way for all of the challenges to be migrated over.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that @BerkeleyTrue has a large, unmerged PR related to the new app layout (and possibly the React challenges as well?). There will possibly be merge conflicts between these two branches, so I'll defer to you guys to decide how to proceed from here.\r\n\r\nHere, @no-stack-dub-sack and I are ready to go and begin migrating all the challenges over. That will be a pretty tedious process, but I think that is all that is left now (with the exception of QA) after a consensus is reached on how to integrate these changes into the app. We could either, work on this branch until all the challenges are included here, or, merge this support in and then just start making smaller PRs that add in the actual challenges.\r\n\r\n### Main Notes:\r\n\r\n- I provided the React/Redux challenges with a new `challengeType`, `8`, in order to differentiate them from the other challenges. For the most part, they are treated like `js` challenges, but this allows us to throw a new error toast if code transpilation fails and potentially pipe these challenges through a separate transformation process (to provide the `stage-2` preset). I can expand on this later if needed.\r\n- The challenges rely on many dependencies in order to work, e.g. React, Redux, React-Redux packages. I provided these packages via imports directly within the app onto the document which runs the tests. The Enzyme methods we utilize are provide in a simliar manner.\r\n- I don't know how the unique IDs are generated from the challenges (in the JSON files). I was just changing random characters in the IDs to get the challenges to seed the database.\r\n- I also added an `npm restart` script which reseeds the database and restarts the server in one command to make the process of updating challenges a little more streamlined.\r\n- The automated tests that Gulp performs should be compatible with many of the React challenges now. However, there were some problems related to enabling class property transforms with Babel and with running certain Enzyme tests which are not yet resolved, however these should only affect a few challenges.\r\n\r\nI have some more notes, but they are more related to get the tests for the challenges working correctly. If we move forward with migrating these I'd be happy to create an issue to track that process and document the other notes I have.\r\n\r\n### Demo:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"react\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18126719/26164242/ee379f22-3ae0-11e7-99c5-4d760793de71.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"react-redux\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18126719/26164267/029b5922-3ae1-11e7-88e8-69822695ff1d.png\">\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Pre-Submission Checklist\r\n- [x] Your pull request targets the `staging` branch of freeCodeCamp.\r\n- [x] Branch starts with either `fix/`, `feature/`, or `translate/` (e.g. `fix/signin-issue`)\r\n- [ ] You have only one commit (if not, [squash](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/how-to-squash-multiple-commits-into-one-with-git/13231) them into one commit): commits unsquashed for review.\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests pass the command `npm test`.

Moved the less rules over to `challenges.less`, changing the namespacing of the instructions class names to `challenges` rather than `classic`. \r\n\r\nA couple of notes:\r\n- could not get `npm test` to pass because of the `propTypes` objects in `Back-End.jsx` - it looks like since the redux form prop types are spread out into `propTypes`, the final result is not alphabetical. I didn't make any changes here, so I'm guessing the test was only triggered because I edited the file and that this is an issue that was encountered in the past?\r\n- I was getting some weird behavior with the `challenges-instructions` styles. Everything seems to work correctly (verified in `main.css` that all the rules look correct), but when making and saving changes in JS files, occasionally it would seem as if the styles weren't applied, then I'd make another change and they'd be back. So not sure what's up with that, but I believe the rules are correct. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you think everything looks good.\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes a slight change to the backend challenges component to improve responsiveness at smaller screen resolutions. Previously, w/ `xs={ 12 }`, the result was too wide and content gets cutoff unless you scroll:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18563015/26385167/ac335fd2-400b-11e7-92c3-cb54e03744f3.png)\r\n\r\nSo just changed it all too `xs={ 6 }`, && `xsOffset={ 3 }`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18563015/26385136/7801511a-400b-11e7-9121-9477972acb09.png)\r\n\r\n",

Removed references to `name` attribute.  Also in general tried to simplify/shorten the lesson as it was longer than other lessons in this section.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for review and feedback!\r\n\r\nEdit - Forgot to mention that this was brought to attention due to an [issue ](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/testable-projects-fcc/issues/143) opened on _testable-projects-fcc_ repo.   In the test suite, there is a test that checks for an `id `of a internal link target element instead of a `name`.   It seemed better to update the lesson than change the test after learning that `a` tag `name ` attribute is obsolete.\r\n",

them currently).\r\n* These challenges rely on `editor.getOriginalCode()` to provide the original, untranspiled code string.\r\n* Transpiled `head` and `tail` code is required in the FCC editor during for some of these challenges but is currently not working.\r\n* Preview function is currently not working for these challenges.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Type of Change\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds new functionality)\r\n- [x] Closes #16115\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nMigrate the React-Redux Curriculum from the [prototype module](https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module) into the FCC codebase.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] Populate challenge files (title, description, seed code, solution).\r\n- [x] Challenge solutions pass tests under automated test suite.\r\n- [x] Manually check solutions work in app.\r\n- [x] QA challenge & test copy\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Motivational Images\r\n\r\n![screen shot

There were a few formatting issues since @BerkeleyTrue's recent changes which affected some syntax we used, and more importantly, adds back `<div id='challenge-node'></div>` to the React challenge template for the ReactDOM challenges which were broken with the change. \r\n\r\n@BerkeleyTrue Also, and I'm a bit befuddled by this, but apparently the `code` variable now seems to contain the untranspiled ES6 code? This was clearly not the case a few months ago, but @Ethan-Arrowood's recent work on the ES6 challenges highlighted this for me, because he seemed to be able to get the original code strings without using your `getUserInput =>` syntax... so not quite sure when this happened, but since this seems to work, I replaced all of that syntax with `code` because its much more readable and intuitive. \r\n\r\n@QuincyLarson A few other finishing touches and fixes, but everything I've touched on seems to work, but I'm sure the challenges could use a once over QA with someone actually completing each challenge. @Ethan-Arrowood QA'd them for copy and formatting, but I don't believe for working challenges, and since we're not testing them automatically, this would be a good last step if you can find a few volunteers to run through all 3 sections. \r\n\r\nP.S. I couldn't seem to fix this formatting issue with the new async challenge syntax which @BerkeleyTrue just introduced:\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18563015/34143351-516ceba6-e45a-11e7-8194-592b154600fc.png)\r\n",

The MailHog section was in the middle of the \"Set Up freeCodeCamp\" section. That made it difficult to skim over the section that was not relevant to your OS. I moved it out into its own section and added titles to it.\r\n2. There were duplicate sections about naming and squashing commits. I kept the ones that were necessary in the step-by-step PR guide.\r\n3. Most titles used Title Case, but not all of them did. I made them more consistent.\r\n4. I added instructions for the `cp sample.env .env` command on Windows. With this change, I believe it's finally possible to follow this guide on Windows and end up with a working installation \ud83d\ude4c\r\n5. I changed all instances of \"FCC\" to \"freeCodeCamp\". https://twitter.com/ossia/status/941412790325141506\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We also have toasts messages. We should take care to distinguish between the two uses cases for these two very difference styles. We should use flash as we always have, sending messages between backend and the client app. Toasts should be notifications from the client app to the user. (There are also Modals, but don't get me started on those.)\r\n\r\n* updates webpack to latest\r\n* fetches flash messages on load\r\n* builds frameRunner through webpack (it is now possible to import modules directly there instead of passing things around through the document object)\r\n* fixes flash race condition\r\n* makes flash function standard with the rest of the world\r\n* factor settings toggle buttons into their own decoupled component\r\n* refactors settings page rendering logic\r\n* app now takes up full width/height of window without js logic",

After running `npm run only-once`, the script failed at `node seed` and logged the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/freeCodeCamp/seed/index.js:91\r\n                  ...file,\r\n                  ^^^\r\n\r\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token ...\r\n    at createScript (vm.js:56:10)\r\n    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:97:10)\r\n    at Module._compile (module.js:542:28)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:579:10)\r\n    at Module.load (module.js:487:32)\r\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:446:12)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:438:3)\r\n    at Module.runMain (module.js:604:10)\r\n    at run (bootstrap_node.js:383:7)\r\n    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:149:9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI went ahead and removed that spread operator from `file` in `index.js` and was able to seed the database successfully and get the application running after that, but thought it was pretty strange that happened. I didn't commit my changes to `index.js` in this PR, but just wanted to call that out in case it's related to a separate issue.",

However, according to the MDN web docs for [HTMLInputElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement), the `value` attribute of the Input Element in HTML is always of type String. Even the type attribute only alters the \"type of control to display\"\u2014the value of an input with `type=\"number\"` is still stored as a string. \r\n\r\nThe challenge, on ternary operators, necessitates checking if an input value (`this.state.userAge`) is empty. As a consequence:\r\n```js\r\n// the tests will green-light this boolean expression; numbers !== strings\r\nthis.state.userAge !== \"\" ? ... \r\n\r\n// this boolean expression does not work; unlike strings, numbers have no length attribute\r\nthis.state.userAge > 0 ? ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### My Solution\r\n\r\nI've changed the input values three tests were feeding the challenge from numbers to strings. That way, users can use both of these booleans to test the non-emptiness of the input:\r\n```\r\n1) inputText !== \"\";\r\n2) inputText.length > 0;\r\n",

However, there is no explanation of its meaning or what it does anywhere. This PR hopes to provide a better learning experience for the user in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt differs from #16650, which addresses the same issue, in the following ways:\r\n- **It provides an example.** Most JavaScript beginners do not understand what the \"unsafe actions\" in #16650 are; I provide a two-line code example (long enough to let the user understand, but short enough to not clutter the page with directions).\r\n- **It is more sensibly worded.** The explanation in #16650 is not only a run-on sentence, but it also exhibits a misunderstanding of Strict Mode (inferred from incorrect usage of capitalization, quotes, and syntax).\r\n- **The description location is correct.** My explanation is grouped with the introductory description of the challenge, unlike #16650's, which is grouped in the challenge instructions section.\r\n- _The branch name is correct \ud83d\ude1c_ ([contributing guidelines](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md))",

The test failed to detect a closed audio tag and threw an error (`cannot read property 'length' of null`) in the console.\r\n\r\nFaulty regex: `/<audio id=\\\"meowClip\\\" controls>/g`. The addition of the \"meowClip\" id attribute in the audio tag test was never specified in the directions and seems to have mistaken the challenge description (which uses a `<audio id=\"meowClip\">` tag as an example) for a solution. \r\n\r\nSince the faulty regex would never match anything and the test used a `.match(...).length` to check if the number of closing tags matched the number of opening tags, it threw the aforementioned error `cannot read property 'length' of null`. \r\n\r\nI've replaced the regex to simply be `/<audio>/g` and added an extra boolean to prevent the null-case.\r\n",

The tail in the seed contained a `ReactDOM.render` line, thus resulting in two renders. \r\n\r\nMy solution was to just remove the test and modify the solution to match that deletion. Currently, it is inconsistent with the behaviors of all of the other React DOM element challenges. For example, in the challenge before, [Define an HTML Class in JSX](https://beta.freecodecamp.org/en/challenges/react/define-an-html-class-in-jsx), no `ReactDOM.render` is needed to pass the challenge.\r\n\r\n",

The class <code>btn-default</code> was missing and was added.\r\n\r\nI'd also removed green styling for two buttons in the description in the lesson with using the <code>btn-block</code> class. This approach could be more clear for weaker users which sometimes get lost, when description it's not 1 to 1 with the example, either exercise. I've left the hover untouched.\r\n\r\nThis PR possibly closes #17075 but, there was a question of the rendering of the buttons too, which is still unanswered (in my environment the rendering bug doesn't exist).\r\n\r\nWell, if the changes gonna be accepted the translation need to be done - this is the thing I've forgotten to ask, how you deal with it?",

Change this line https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/staging/seed/index.js#L87\r\nTo this - `challenge.dashedName = dasherize(challenge.title);`\r\n\r\n2. Change the title of the first challenge to this - `\u201dSay Hello to HTML-Elements\u201d` (added a hyphen) - this is the line\u2026\r\nhttps://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/staging/seed/challenges/01-responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5.json#L9 - I did this because we can't sign in locally so the current-challenge is always the first one - so I added a hyphen to the first challenge\r\n\r\n3. Seed the DB\r\n\r\n4. Change `learnURL` variable to `http://localhost:8000` so it will redirect to the local learn - this line\u2026\r\nhttps://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/staging/server/boot/challenge.js#L14\r\n\r\n5. Run local FCC and Learn environments\r\n\r\n6. Go to `localhost:3000/challenges/current-challenge` - and it will redirect correctly to `http://localhost:8000/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements`\r\n\r\nIf you omit step 1 and do steps 2-6 it will incorrectly redirect to `http://localhost:8000/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-htmlelements`\r\n\r\nI think this is all accurate and it seems to work - my only concern with this solution is that `dashedName` needs to stay how it is now for other reasons I am unaware of - another possible solution would maybe be to remove all the hyphens from the seed files, or maybe change namify() so it doesn't remove hyphens\r\n",

Offsetting this negative margin creates space between the edge of the page and the text. A similar change was made by editing the max-width of certain buttons so that the edges would not touch on mobile.\r\n\r\nAlso, added a min-width to the btn-group on the settings page to prevent the buttons from collapsing on top of one another which previously began happening around 700px-900px\r\n\r\nAlmost all changes involve media queries as to avoid negatively effecting the desktop version.\r\n<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n",

The problem was that, in SocialIcons.jsx, the \"linkedIn\" property that was made in the createSelector function did not match the \"linkedin\" property in user.json, which did not allow SocialIcons.jsx to receive the linkedin data that was passed from the Internet Presence form in the settings page. So I changed the linkedIn property in SocialIcons.jsx from \"linkedIn\" to \"linkedin\" and now the LinkedIn icon on the profile page has a link that goes to the user's LinkedIn URL.\r\n",

I think it would be good to show both approaches, as these examples can be a good reference point for people. \r\n- Changed the `avoid-mutations-and-side-effects...` exercise to use a passed in argument instead of the global variable. This is more in line with the idea of using functions that provide outputs which are purely dependent on their inputs. \r\n- Edited the `use-the-map-method...` exercise to stringify the console output, so people doing the exercise can actually see their outputs. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please follow this checklist and put an x in each of the boxes, like this: [x].

        "description": "Made minor improvements to the advanced solution:\r\n\r\n1. The original advanced solution used `Math.max` and `Math.min` against the supplied array, this causes the values in the supplied array to be compared twice. If we use `sort` instead, the values are only compared once and we can target the `max` and `min` values using an index. This is more efficient.\r\n\r\n2. The original solution caused `lcm(min, min + 1)` to be evaluated twice. By incrementing `min` the first time we run `lcm` we avoid this duplication and also by taking advantage of the prefix increment operator `++min` in the `while` loop, we trim a line.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please follow this checklist and put an x in each of the boxes, like this: [x].

Most of the things I noticed were places where words would be formatted as code on one page, but not another. (ex \"`anchor` element\" vs \"anchor element\"). Other small fixes include a missing period and changing things like \"`radio buttons`\" to \"`radio button`s\".\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want any of the changes reverted or want a different style applied.
